# NERC Management System
The project is an ASP.NET MVC 5 web app created for online representation of the [National Engineering Robotics Contest (NERC)](http://nerc.com.pk), an event organized and hosted by Department of Mechatronics Engineering at [National University of Sciences and Technology](http://nust.edu.pk).

The web app consists of basic views for event information, alongwith a complete system for online registrations. 

## Requirements
Following are development requirements for testing out the project:
- Microsoft Visual Studio
- Microsoft SQL Server

## Disclaimer
This is an unmaintained repository and might not represent the code currently running on NERC production server. It was uploaded online for academic purposes to fulfill requirement of the semester project for course of Object Oriented Programming, and hence might have a lot of scope for improvement.
